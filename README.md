# Atlan Task
Backend Challenge for internship at Atlan

This repository contains the code for making a form. For my case, I have added a form for a governments delivering vaccines to small business owners managing their daily inventory.
The form contains a set of questions the answers to whom can be text, numbers, email IDs or optional questions.

The entire code base is provided and the steps to establish the setup are also provided below.
The fetures that are implemented in this task from the problem statement are:

1. The form responses are stored in a google sheet having link - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DyrT2SekXp19FbdZHEEOtm-wMjiqR3vD40Hi8-ndCvg/edit?usp=sharing

2. For every form response, a well set of of rules have been defined to perform validation checks on them. This will ensure that only valid data is entered into our data store.
